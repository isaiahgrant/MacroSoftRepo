*If we eventually make a GUI, consider making the graphics resource a singleton? That way 
anyone has access to it? And store it in a global resources type file? But, is that bad design?
Global resource?

*Don't exactly understand folder structure of iterations/current working. Do we just 
set aside an iteration when it is finished into the FullyFunctionalVersions? If so,
why do we have a Trivia_Maze_v1.0 folder inside the current directory?



*iterations did not belong under that folder so I moved it. That restores the original intent of being able to copy Trivia_Maze_v1.0 to fullyFunctionalVersions once ready. 
*I included the eclipse folder in v1.0 folder and cleaned up directories.

**if you have any files in currentWorkingDirectory please make sure one copy is in Iteration_1 and the other is in the eclipse src folder

*I have created a sub folder under rescouces for class supporting documents
